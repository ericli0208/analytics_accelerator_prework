/* SUBQUERIES and TABLE EXPRESSIONS are methods for being able to write a query that creates a table, and then write a query that interacts with this newly created table. 
Sometimes the question you are trying to answer doesn't have an answer when working directly with existing tables in database.
However, if we were able to create new tables from the existing tables, we know we could query these new tables to answer our question. */
